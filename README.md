Perfect 👌 Let’s make a clean and professional **README.md** for your WhatsApp-style chat app. It will:

* Introduce the project
* Show current features
* Mention tech stack
* Show how to run (basic instructions)
* Mention that it’s still under development

Here’s a draft:

# WhatsApp-Style Real-Time Chat App 🚀  

A full-stack chat application inspired by WhatsApp, built with **Next.js, MERN, Socket.IO, Docker, and Redis/Valkey PubSub**.  
This project is still **under development** — I’m actively building new features and refining the architecture.  

---

## ✨ Features (so far)
- 🔐 Authentication with JWT (Auth Backend)  
- 👥 Multiple client instances (users can log in on different ports)  
- 💬 Real-time messaging with **Socket.IO**  
- 🐳 Dockerized setup (frontend, backend, auth backend, Redis)  
- 🔄 Pub/Sub with **ioredis + Valkey** for reliable message delivery  
- 📥 Offline messaging groundwork (deliver messages when users reconnect)  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, Zustand, TailwindCSS)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO  
- **Auth Service:** Node.js + Express + JWT  
- **Messaging Layer:** Redis (Valkey via Aiven) + ioredis (Pub/Sub)  
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## ⚡ Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whatsapp-fs-sockets.git
cd whatsapp-fs-sockets
````

### 2️⃣ Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in each service (backend, auth-backend, frontend) and add:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SERVICE_URI=your_redis_valkey_uri
```

### 3️⃣ Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4️⃣ Access clients

* Frontend 1: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Frontend 2: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
* Backend (chat): [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Auth Backend: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

## 📌 Next Steps

* ✅ Real-time messaging
* ✅ Docker containerization
* ✅ Pub/Sub messaging with Redis/Valkey
* ⏳ Offline messaging queue
* ⏳ Group chats
* ⏳ File sharing (images, docs)
* ⏳ Deployment to cloud (AWS / Azure)
